# My Vegan Buddy

A four-page web app featuring a search engine to aid vegans on finding recipes and nutritional information.


### Description

> My Vegan Buddy is a virtual pal who helps both vegans and meat eaters to find vegan recipes and their nutritional information. It conveys an easy way to become and to remain suffering-free. 

---

#### User Stories

> - _"I've tried to turn vegan a few times, but its so hard to do it without planning! I wish there was a platform where I could simply type the ingredients I have and it turn out with bunch of recipes to try it."_
> - _"My partner is vegan, and I always spend ages trying to find the best recipe to cook for her. It'd be awesome if there's a way for me to have different ideas with a simple tap of my finger."_
> - _"My friends and I are all big gym goers, and I've been trying to convince them to turn vegan for ages now, but it is so difficult to find resources out there that have (real) nutritional information online."_
> - _"Working and studying take a lot of time, so cooking is not always possible - being vegan, that means my options are often reduced. I'd like to be able to find new ideas that fit in my schedule."_


---

### UX

> - My Vegan Buddy is a platform aimed at everyone trying to find vegan recipes. It is meant to be an aid for people to chose a healthier diet - it has a simple yet effective layout, with constrasting elements and an easy to understand data output.

#### 1. Strategy

> The goal of this project is to offer a tool which will help people make better choices when it comes to their diet.
>
> ##### Project Goals:
>
> - Offer a search engine for users to find recipes and explore a vegan diet.
>
> - Help vegans and meat-eaters to have a healthier lifestyle that fits in their schedule.
>
> - Disseminate a vegan lifestyle.
>
> ##### Customer Goals:
>
> - Layout using Mobile-first approach.
> - Clear and well-displayed content for a straightforward and quick search.
> - Find nutritional information relevant to each recipe.
> - Footer supplying links to Social Media.
> - Effortless way to sign-up for newsletter service.
> - Reduced time to load the app and content, for an enhanced experience.

#### 2. Scope

> The focus here is to achieve a version of the website with just enough features to be usable - the concept of Minimum viable product (MVP), that contains:
>
> - Search engine to find vegan recipes, with options to search for them by name or ingredient.
> - Nutritional information of the recipe.
> - Rating system, time for cooking and portion size for each recipe.
> - Sign-up form for newsletter service.
> - Features that match my current knowledge.

#### 3. Structure

> Due to the complexity of the data that we mean to present to the user, the structure plan was thought-through from the simplest standpoint possible, that is, to present the data in a layout that is already known by the user.
> The concept of search engines and how the results are presented are well-known to the user - the same goes for culinary recipes. Traditionally, this type of content follows a straightforward path and thats how we conveyed the content and the structure for the app.

#### 4. Skeleton

> - [Wire frames](assets/docs/wireframes.pdf): Four-page website.
>
> - Home, About, Results and Recipe pages.
>
> - Navigation bar - Links to each page.
>
> - Footer with social media link and copyrights.

#### 5. Surface

Through some research, I've found that Gym websites praise contrast between colour palettes, so I've picked darker tones in contrast with brighter colors, albeit with darker tonalities.

> ##### Colours
>
> Darker graphite tonalities, black-and-white hero image in contrast with brighter tones - to make components "jump" and to mimic movement. 
> - I've picked a bright, deep ocean blue(#003049) for one of the background-wrappers and a leafy green(#003049) for the other. 
> - For body text, I've used a combination of regular black, white smoke for the bright text. For the button togglers and the text the jumbo tron, I've chosen a darker "blood-red" (#AE3A21)
> 
> ##### Typography
>
> - "TEKO" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for main headings. This font was picked for its hard angles, to create a stronger contrast with "background-colours".
> - "Roboto" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for body content.
>
> ##### Images
>
> The images are a representation of what a GYM would have for infrastructure, as a way for customers to see it before visiting the club.

### Bugs and turnarounds

> - Issues to create the API request, by putting the URL together. Ended it up finding a solution by using template literals - String Interpolation.
> - I had issues in transforming and accessing the object returned by the API's request. Transformed in a JSON object and accessed the ".results" property to iterate through the object.
> - Bug encountered when rendering "bootstrap-card-group" on large screens. To solve this issue, I have used bootstrap grid layout (*.col-12).
> - Bug found on filling FontAwesome starts according to rating from API. Found solution on: [A Simple JavaScript Technique for Filling Star Ratings](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-simple-javascript-technique-for-filling-star-ratings--cms-29450).
> - Found a bug trying to render the recipe to another HTML page. The turnaround was offered by Victor (my mentor), by saving the target HTML element to 'localStorage', changing to another page using 'window.location.href' property and loading the saved content from 'localStorage'.  
> - Bug requesting recipe from reined_search = throwing errors such as "Illegal Invocation" or "Failed to fetch" - string interpolation did not work. 
> - Used this tutorial:[https://ultimatecourses.com/blog/transform-formdata-into-query-string].

### Deployment

This project has been deployed on GitHub Pages with the following process:

> - All code was written on Gitpod, an online IDE.
> - The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my [Repository](https://github.com/vinnieOrdobas/Code-Institute-MS1).
> - Under the [settings](https://github.com/vinnieOrdobas/Code-Institute-MS1) section of the GitHub repository, scrolled down to GitHub Pages section.
> - Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.
> - Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site url.
> - There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.
> - The code can be run locally through clone or download.
> - You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.
