# My Vegan Buddy

A four-page web app featuring a search engine to aid vegans on finding recipes and nutritional information.


### Description

> My Vegan Buddy is a virtual pal who helps both vegans and meat eaters to find vegan recipes and their nutritional information. It conveys an easy way to become and to remain suffering-free. 

---

#### User Stories

> - _"I've tried to turn vegan a few times, but its so hard to do it without planning! I wish there was a platform where I could simply type the ingredients I have and it turn out with bunch of recipes to try it."_
> - _"My partner is vegan, and I always spend ages trying to find the best recipe to cook for her. It'd be awesome if there's a way for me to have different ideas with a simple tap of my finger."_
> - _"My friends and I are all big gym goers, and I've been trying to convince them to turn vegan for ages now, but it is so difficult to find resources out there that have (real) nutritional information online."_
> - _"Working and studying take a lot of time, so cooking is not always possible - being vegan, that means my options are often reduced. I'd like to be able to find new ideas that fit in my schedule."_

### UX

My Vegan Buddy is a platform aimed at everyone trying to find vegan recipes. It is meant to be an aid for people to chose a healthier diet - it has a simple yet effective layout, with constrasting elements and an easy to understand data output.
---

#### 1. Strategy

> The goal of this project is to offer a tool which will help people make better choices when it comes to their diet.
>
> ##### Project Goals:
>
> - Offer a search engine for users to find recipes and explore a vegan diet.
>
> - Help vegans and meat-eaters to have a healthier lifestyle that fits in their schedule.
>
> - Disseminate a vegan lifestyle.
>
> ##### Customer Goals:
>
> - Layout using Mobile-first approach.
> - Clear and well-displayed content for a straightforward and quick search.
> - Find nutritional information relevant to each recipe.
> - Footer supplying links to Social Media.
> - Effortless way to sign-up for newsletter service.
> - Reduced time to load the app and content, for an enhanced experience.

#### 2. Scope

> The focus here is to achieve a version of the website with just enough features to be usable - the concept of Minimum viable product (MVP), that contains:
>
> - Catalog with pictures depicting the amenities of the club.
> - Map location of the club.
> - Sign-up form.
> - Straightforward UX for the users.
> - Features that match my current knowledge.
#### 3. Structure

> On the structure plan, the effort was concentrated on prompting the user to quickly understand the layout of the page and find the content easily digestible - hence the content is structured on a bite-size framework. 
> The gallery presents pictures of the club and are organised in a simple slide show widget with a brief description of the room â†’ navigation bar intends to improve the returning user's experience.

#### 4. Skeleton

> - [Wire frames](assets/docs/wireframes.pdf): One-page website with five sections
>
> - Home, About, Gallery, Crew and Sign-Up/Contact sections.
>
> - Navigation bar - Links to each section with a sign-in option.
>
> - Footer with social media link and copyrights.

#### 5. Surface

Through some research, I've found that Gym websites praise contrast between colour palettes, so I've picked darker tones in contrast with brighter colors, albeit with darker tonalities.

> ##### Colours
>
> Darker graphite tonalities, black-and-white hero image in contrast with brighter tones - to make components "jump" and to mimic movement. 
> - I've picked a bright, deep ocean blue(#003049) for one of the background-wrappers and a leafy green(#003049) for the other. 
> - For body text, I've used a combination of regular black, white smoke for the bright text. For the button togglers and the text the jumbo tron, I've chosen a darker "blood-red" (#AE3A21)
> 
> ##### Typography
>
> - "TEKO" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for main headings. This font was picked for its hard angles, to create a stronger contrast with "background-colours".
> - "Roboto" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for body content.
>
> ##### Images
>
> The images are a representation of what a GYM would have for infrastructure, as a way for customers to see it before visiting the club.

### Bugs and turnarounds

> - The "Crew" section had aligning issues with lack of structure. The way around was to use a code snippet I found on [WrapPixel](https://snippets.wrappixel.com/bootstrap-our-team-section/) and change the structure slightly.
> - Faced issues with spacing the rounded-pictures for the crew section. Wrapped the content in bootstrap class with flex box properties to space them out evenly.
> - Meet the crew section had issues with image size for different devices - the rounded pictures were to big for smaller devices. Found the solution on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29641526/how-can-images-be-resized-using-bootstrap#:~:text=Use%20class%3D%22img%2Dresponsive,Its%20a%20bootstrap%20class).
> - Rounded pictures had different sizes, which was pushing the subtitle and the description of each member to different places.
> - Had issues to push the social media links in the footer section to the right. Wrapped the content in a bootstrap class container which uses flex box technology to horizontally align content to the right.
> - Footer section had issues on mobile devices, as the sizing would get scrambled. Fixed by wrapping in a container only visible on medium screens and above, and created another one only for smaller screens.
> - Carousel was aligning to the left side of the page, used bootstrap class with flex box properties to create space around the gallery and centralize it.
> - Carousel rendered too small for mobile phones, which led me to choose a different type of gallery(static) for smaller devices.
> - Carousel images on desktop were too wide and big, which led me to wrap the around another container to keep it consistent and easier to navigate through them.
> - On the find us section, I had issues with embedding the map. I followed the tutorial found on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/UqXeX1Irv5o) - How to Make a Responsive Google Map Embed with CSS (EASY), by garnatti one.
> - In order to align the content in one section, I wrapped the Google maps snippet and the find us content in a card deck.
> - Background image wasn't rendering well on mobile devices (it was rendering well on Dev Tools, not on mobile devices per se.) I asked the question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65139910/background-image-appears-zoomed-in-on-mobile-screens) and found the solution.
